We designed five interactive LearningApps games built around an Escape Room narrative focused on prime numbers. You take on the role of a secret agent, and each game functions as a mission challenge where you must use prime-number reasoning to progress. Every task reveals a new layer of the operation, and only by successfully completing all five challenges can you break out. The experience blends logical thinking, number theory, and a mission-driven storyline into a coherent, engaging sequence.
