## 📘 Topic: Modular Arithmetic

### 🟢 Exercise 1 – Kahoot Quiz
- **Tool**: Kahoot  
- **Link**: [Play the quiz](https://kahoot.it/...)  
- **Description**: A short 5-question quiz on modular arithmetic basics (remainders, inverses).  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  Modular arithmetic is the basis of many cryptographic operations, including RSA and ECC.  
  It ensures that operations "wrap around" after reaching a modulus.

### 🔵 Exercise 2 – Miro Puzzle
- **Tool**: Miro  
- **Link**: [Solve the puzzle](https://miro.com/...)  
- **Description**: Drag-and-drop game where students match numbers to their modular inverses in **ℤ₁₄***.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  The concept of *inverses* is central to modular groups, ensuring decryption can reverse encryption.

### 🟣 Exercise 3 – Other Tool (e.g., Quizizz, H5P, LearningApps)
- **Tool**: Quizizz  
- **Link**: [Try it here](https://quizizz.com/...)  
- **Description**: Multiple-choice puzzle with exponentiation mod n.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  Exponentiation in modular arithmetic is used in **Diffie–Hellman** key exchange and RSA.
