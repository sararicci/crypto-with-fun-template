### 🟩 Exercise 1 – Terminology & Basics Quiz   -- Eniola Adesuyi
**Tool:** Kahoot  
**Link:** [https://create.kahoot.it/my-library/kahoots/3d20e4c7-5bba-40e1-80c3-7a4138891c82]  
**Description:**  
Multiple choice to understand the concept of History and Terminology of Cryptography.

**Crypto concept explained:**  
The history of cryptography explains how humans have protected information for thousands of years from simple ancient ciphers like Caesar shifts to complex rotor machines like Enigma and today’s mathematical algorithms. Understanding this evolution shows why certain techniques failed and how modern cryptography became stronger.

### 🟨 Exercise 3 – Miro Puzzle Pack (History & CIA)   -- Tamerlan Jabiyev
**Tool:** Miro  
**Link:** [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJnKPIfM=/?share_link_id=887118566962]
**Description:** 
On miro board we have 5 games and their description. In one board we can drag-drop games, true-false, and so on. 

**Crypto concept explained:**  
These activities explain key crypto terms, the CIA Triad, and classical cipher types, helping students connect historical methods with modern security concepts.

## 📝 Summary
Through these 3 exercises, we explored:
-The evolution of cryptography from ancient ciphers to modern algorithms, understanding how historical developments shaped today’s secure systems.
-Fundamental cryptographic terminology, including plaintext, ciphertext, encryption, decryption, keys, and how they work together.
-Core security goals via the CIA Triad — how confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity protect information in real-world scenarios.
-Basic cryptographic mechanisms such as encryption, hashing, and key management, and how they contribute to secure communication.
