## 📘 Topic: Random Number Generation

### 🟢 Exercise 1 – Wayground Quiz (Joshua Nwokoye)
- **Tool**: Wayground  
- **Link**: [Play the quiz](https://kahoot.it/...)  
- **Description**: A short 10-question quiz on the fundamentals of Randomness.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  The core cryptographic concepts covered are the fundamental definitions of randomness and entropy. It distinguishes between True Random Number Generators (TRNG), which rely on physical noise sources, and Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG), which use deterministic algorithms initialized by a seed.

### 🔵 Exercise 2 – Miro Puzzle (Lungu Masauso)
- **Tool**: Miro  
- **Link**: [Solve the puzzle](https://miro.com/...)  
- **Description**: Drag-and-drop game where students match generator algorithms (LCG, Mersenne Twister) to their properties.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  This exercise illustrates the mechanics of specific generators, such as the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and the Blum Blum Shub algorithm. It highlights the critical difference between fast, predictable generators and those that are cryptographically strong based on hard mathematical problems like integer factorization.

### 🟣 Exercise 3 – Kahoot (Arun Chittuparambil Polson)
- **Tool**: Kahoot
- **Link**: [Try it here](https://kahoot.com/...)  
- **Description**: Multiple-choice puzzle focused on security testing and validation.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  This section explores how we validate randomness using statistical methods like the Frequency and Serial tests. It further explains the strict requirements for a Cryptographically Secure PRNG (CSPRNG), specifically the "Next bit test" and "Forward security," which ensure an attacker cannot predict future or past sequence values.

## 📝 Summary
The questions cover four primary topics in Random Number Generation:

* **Randomness and Entropy Fundamentals**: The definition of random numbers as a uniform selection from a set, the distinction between objective Uniformity and subjective Predictability, and the use of Shannon's Entropy to measure the uncertainty or "surprise" in a sequence.
* **Generator Classifications (TRNG vs. PRNG)**: The operational differences between True Random Number Generators (TRNG), which rely on physical phenomena like thermal noise, and Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG), which use deterministic algorithms initiated by a seed.
* **Algorithmic Implementations**: The mechanics of specific generators, including the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (fast but cryptographically insecure), and the Blum Blum Shub algorithm (secure based on the difficulty of integer factorization).
* **Security Criteria and Validation**: The requirements for a Cryptographically Secure PRNG (CSPRNG), specifically the Next bit test and Forward security, and the application of statistical tests such as Frequency, Serial, Poker, and Autocorrelation tests to detect weaknesses.
