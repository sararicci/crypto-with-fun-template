## 📘 Topic: Modular Arithmetic

### 🟢 Exercise 1 – Wayground Quiz
- **Tool**: Wayground  
- **Link**: [Play the quiz](https://kahoot.it/...)  
- **Description**: A short 10-question quiz on modular arithmetic.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  The core cryptographic concepts covered are modular arithmetic and its algebraic structures, 
  particularly groups. Modular arithmetic provides a finite number system essential for cryptography, 
  while groups—especially multiplicative groups of integers modulo a prime—form the foundation for key exchange, 
  digital signatures, and public-key encryption algorithms.

### 🔵 Exercise 2 – Miro Puzzle
- **Tool**: Miro  
- **Link**: [Solve the puzzle](https://miro.com/...)  
- **Description**: Drag-and-drop game where students match numbers to their modular inverses in **ℤ₁₄***.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  The concept of *inverses* is central to modular groups, ensuring decryption can reverse encryption.

### 🟣 Exercise 3 – Other Tool (e.g., Quizizz, H5P, LearningApps)
- **Tool**: Quizizz  
- **Link**: [Try it here](https://quizizz.com/...)  
- **Description**: Multiple-choice puzzle with exponentiation mod n.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  Exponentiation in modular arithmetic is used in **Diffie–Hellman** key exchange and RSA.

## 📝 Summary
The questions cover four primary topics in Foundations of Cryptography:  
- **Modular Arithmetic Fundamentals**: Concepts of congruence, the role of the remainder, basic modular addition/multiplication, and the finite nature of the set $\text{Z\_n}$.
- **Modular Inverses and Algorithms**: The condition for existence of the multiplicative inverse ($\gcd(a, n) = 1$), finding inverses using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA), and the use of additive inverses in modular subtraction.
- **Number Theory Theorems**: Application of Little Fermat's Theorem (for prime moduli) and Euler's Theorem (for composite moduli) to simplify modular exponentiation, specifically using $\phi(n)$.
- **Group Theory**: Definitions and properties of a Group (axioms), Abelian Group, and the Multiplicative Group $\text{Z_n}$* (set of invertible elements), including calculating the group order, $\phi(n)$.
