## 📘 Topic: Modular Arithmetic

### 🟢 Exercise 1 – Wayground Quiz (Joshua Nwokoye)
- **Tool**: Wayground  
- **Link**: [Play the quiz](https://kahoot.it/...)  
- **Description**: A short 10-question quiz on modular arithmetic.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  The core cryptographic concepts covered are modular arithmetic and its algebraic structures, 
  particularly groups. Modular arithmetic provides a finite number system essential for cryptography, 
  while groups—especially multiplicative groups of integers modulo a prime—form the foundation for key exchange, 
  digital signatures, and public-key encryption algorithms.

### 🔵 Exercise 2 – Miro Puzzle (Lungu Masauso)
- **Tool**: Miro  
- **Link**: [Solve the puzzle](https://miro.com/...)  
- **Description**: Drag-and-drop game where students match numbers to their modular inverses in **ℤ₁₄***.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  The concept of *inverses* is central to modular groups, ensuring decryption can reverse encryption.

### 🟣 Exercise 3 – Kahhot (Arun Chittuparambil Polson)
- **Tool**: Kahoot
- **Link**: [Try it here](https://kahoot.com/...)  
- **Description**: Multiple-choice puzzle with exponentiation mod n.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  Exponentiation in modular arithmetic is used in **Diffie–Hellman** key exchange and RSA.

## 📝 Summary
The questions cover four primary topics in Random Number Generation:

* [cite_start]**Randomness and Entropy Fundamentals**: The definition of random numbers as a uniform selection from a set [cite: 15][cite_start], the distinction between objective **Uniformity** and subjective **Predictability** [cite: 93-95][cite_start], and the use of **Shannon's Entropy** to measure the uncertainty or "surprise" in a sequence[cite: 125, 133].
* [cite_start]**Generator Classifications (TRNG vs. PRNG)**: The operational differences between **True Random Number Generators (TRNG)**, which rely on physical phenomena like thermal noise [cite: 160-163][cite_start], and **Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG)**, which use deterministic algorithms initiated by a seed [cite: 219-220].
* [cite_start]**Algorithmic Implementations**: The mechanics of specific generators, including the **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** and **Mersenne Twister** (fast but cryptographically insecure) [cite: 236-244, 284-290][cite_start], and the **Blum Blum Shub** algorithm (secure based on the difficulty of integer factorization) [cite: 351-356].
* [cite_start]**Security Criteria and Validation**: The requirements for a **Cryptographically Secure PRNG** (CSPRNG), specifically the **Next bit test** and **Forward security** [cite: 344-349][cite_start], and the application of statistical tests such as Frequency, Serial, Poker, and Autocorrelation tests to detect weaknesses [cite: 427-432].
