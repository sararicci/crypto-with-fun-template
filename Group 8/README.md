# 🔐 Group Ederra, Navarro, Oliva – Crypto with Fun!

Welcome to our project!  
This page contains our 3 interactive exercises on **Public Key Cryptography**.  
Each exercise is built with a different tool (Kahoot, Miro, Genially).

## 📘 Topic: Public Key Cryptography

### 🟢 Exercise 1 – Kahoot Quiz (Sofía Navarro)
- **Tool**: Kahoot  
- **Link**: [Play the quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/asymmetric-crypography/1c66ecea-b837-46ae-b952-2cb6d9b4739c)
- **Description**: A short 8-question quiz about the introduction of asymmetric cryptography (multiplicative groups, generators, DLP, protocols).  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  Asymmetric cryptography forms the basis for different protocols such as Diffie-Hellman, which relies on Discrete Logarithm Problem and is used for establishing     symmetric encryption key over an insecure channel.

### 🔵 Exercise 2 – Miro Puzzle (Samuel Oliva)
- **Tool**: Miro  
- **Link**: [Solve the puzzle](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJraiO34=/?share_link_id=518127998568)  [Edit the puzzle](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/MzJWb2dJODRUVzZiQ05sR043ZlJKS3BuSEhlY0pBRTlwb1hMY1pqSWl0VHQ5M2NkT054aVJLZVdOY0FzK1JBS2xNY1VoZUdQUHpTajRadXZPV1pWcXdZakYvOFZGY3dQVlQ5UXV2LzlpQlQzMzB3TWlYZVlFOW9KR213RXp3bER3VHhHVHd5UWtSM1BidUtUYmxycDRnPT0hdjE=?share_link_id=274585018015).
- **Description**: Drag-and-drop activity where students reconstruct the correct RSA + OAEP encryption/decryption flow by ordering shuffled process steps.  
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  The puzzle shows how RSA and OAEP work together to provide secure public-key encryption through key generation, padding, and modular exponentiation.

### 🟣 Exercise 3 – Genially (Pablo Ángel Ederra)
- **Tool**: Genially  
- **Link**: [Try it here](https://view.genially.com/6915fe678fd6fe34d15679e8/interactive-content-el-gamal-and-digital-certificates)
- **Description**: Multiple-choice puzzles, true/false questions, and fill-in-the-blank exercises about El Gamal and Digital Certificates.
- **Crypto concept explained**:  
  El Gamal, which is an encryption scheme based on Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), and Digital Certificates, which are still used today as a secure method for      transferring public keys.
