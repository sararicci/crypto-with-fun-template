- **Description**: A short 5-question interactive quiz testing your knowledge of hash functions in real-world scenarios. Challenge yourself on topics like file integrity verification, password storage, and cryptographic security.
#### **Crypto concept explained**:  

**Hash functions** are one-way mathematical algorithms that transform input data of any size into a fixed-size output (hash/digest). 
They are fundamental to modern cryptography and have three key properties:

1. Deterministic: Same input always produces the same hash
2. One-way: Cannot reverse the hash to get original input
3. Collision-resistant: Nearly impossible to find two different inputs with the same hash

**Real-world applications**:

🔒 File Integrity: Verify downloaded files haven't been tampered with (SHA-256 checksums)
🔑 Password Storage: Store hashed passwords instead of plaintext (bcrypt, Argon2)
⛓️ Blockchain: Link blocks together and ensure immutability (Bitcoin uses SHA-256)
🔧 Version Control: Git uses SHA-1 to identify commits and detect corruption
📜 Digital Signatures: Create message digests for signing documents

Common hash algorithms: MD5 (deprecated), SHA-1 (deprecated), SHA-256 (current standard), SHA-3, bcrypt, Argon2
